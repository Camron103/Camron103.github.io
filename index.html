    <h1>Top 5 Movies This Year (2024) </h1>
    <h3>By Camron Raufdeen</h3>
    <h2> <strong>5. Alien: Romulus</strong></h2>

    <p>Another solid film of the Alien franchise. Would've been higher on the list withouth the repetive ending of earlier films. However, the new concept of a alien-human hybrid was a neat aspect which made the movie stand out.</p>
    <h2> <strong>4. Long Legs</strong></h2>

    <p>Long Legs is the best horror movie that has come out in awhile. Nicholas Cage executes his role perfectly, sending chills down the audience. It strays from generic jump-scares and gives viewers a needed, unsettling plot line.</p>
    <h2> <strong>3. Bad Boys: Ride or Die</strong></h2>

    <p> A hilarious film with high stakes to end the series, Bad Boys: Ride or Die delivers what cinema needed. Matrin Lawrence is responsible for this high of a rating, with his heartfealt and entertaining performance throughout. 
       A perfect bland of action/comedy while getting serious when necessary.
    </p> 
    <h2><strong>2. Deadpool and Wolverine</strong></h2>

  <p> Both the return of Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and the comedic tone emphasized by Ryan Reynolds make this movie a top 2 of this year. With Marvel's recent dry spell, Deadpool gives an unserious answer to said issue. 
     This blockbuster would've been higher on the list if it didn't have such a chaotic plot.
  </p>
     <h2><strong> Honorable Mentions:</strong> </h2>
     <ul>
        <li>Ricky Stanicky</li>
        <li>Fall Guy</li>
        <li>Inside Out 2</li>
        <li>Mean Girls(2024)</li>
     </ul>
     <h2><strong>1. Harold and the Purple Crayon</strong></h2>

     <p>Harold and the Purple Crayon is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_and_the_Purple_Crayon">a cinematic masterpiece. </a> Every scene had me shivering in my boots, the movie was an enlightening experience. 
        Zachary Levi being casted as Harold is better casting than Heath Ledger as the Joker. Comedic moments had me dying on the floor, giivng me the greatest ab workout of my life. The sad scenes had me bawling like I had been struck with lightning. 
        I can't even settle on one singular best secene, since even the credits had me awe-struck. The other movies on this list were great, but they don't hold a candle to this miracle.
