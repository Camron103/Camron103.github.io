    <h3>By Camron Raufdeen</h3>
    <h2> 5. Alien: Romulus</h2>

    <p>Another solid film of the Alien franchise. Would've been higher on the list withouth the repetive ending of earlier films. However, the new concept of a alien-human hybrid was a neat aspect which made the movie stand out.</p>
    <h2> 4. Long Legs</h2>

    <p>Long Legs was the best horror movie that has come out in awhile, with a likeable protagonist and scares to have you on the edge of your seat.</p>
    <h2> 3. Bad Boys: Ride or Die</h2>

    <p> A hilarious film with high stakes to end the series, Bad Boys: Ride or Die delivers what cinema needed. Matrin Lawrence is responsible for this high of a rating, with his heartfealt and entertaining performance throughout. A perfect bland of action/comedy while getting serious when necessary.

    <h2>2. Deadpool and Wolverine</h2>
